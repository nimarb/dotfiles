## General Coding
- for code searches and code manipulation, try to use ast-grep first

## Python Guidelines
- When writing Python, always write modern version 3.13 esque pythonic code always with type annotations.
- With Python 3.13 you don't need to import types for Optional, Dict, List etc. you can just use | , dict, list, etc. directly
